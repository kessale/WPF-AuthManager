WPF Login Form Documentation
Overview
This project is a part of a learning process, designed to implement a basic login form using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern in C#. It includes user authentication, navigation between views, and basic user management (add, edit, remove users) using a SQL Server database. The application is not a complete product but serves as a foundation for further development.

Project Structure
The project is structured following the MVVM pattern, enhancing maintainability, and separating the user interface from the logic. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main components:

Models: Represents the data structure of the application.

Customer: Basic model for customer information.
UserModel: Defines the structure for user information including username, password, and personal details.
UserAccountModel: Contains user's account details.
ViewModels: Acts as a mediator between the Models and Views, containing the logic for the user interface.

LoginViewModel: Manages the login logic.
MainViewModel: Handles the main window's logic and navigations.
CustomerViewModel: Manages customer-related functionalities.
Views: The user interface of the application.

LoginView: The login screen.
MainView: The main window after login.
CustomerView: Displays customer information.
Repositories: Provides methods to interact with the database.

UserRepository: Implements IUserRepository, providing methods for user authentication and CRUD operations.
CustomControls: Contains customized WPF controls.

BindablePasswordBox: A custom password box that supports data binding.
